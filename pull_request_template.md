# Code Refactoring: Object-Oriented Options Analysis

## Description

This PR refactors the options analysis codebase from a monolithic script into an object-oriented, modular package structure. The refactoring improves maintainability, testability, and extensibility while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Changes

- Created `options_analysis` package with specialized modules:
  - `market_data.py`: Abstract interface and Yahoo Finance data provider
  - `black_scholes.py`: Calculations for option pricing and Greeks
  - `models.py`: Data classes for option contracts
  - `option_analysis.py`: Analysis logic with `OptionAnalyzer` and `OptionsAnalysisRunner` classes
  - `utils.py`: Logging and utility functions
- Added new `main.py` entry point with comprehensive CLI options
- Kept `analysis.py` as a compatibility wrapper
- Added documentation in package READMEs and migration guide
- Updated project README with new usage instructions

## Key Benefits

1. **Extensibility**: New option types can be easily added without modifying existing code
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns
4. **Flexibility**: Different data sources can be implemented via `MarketDataProvider`
5. **Backward compatibility**: Original entry point still works

## Testing

- Tested basic analysis on AAPL ticker
- Verified that results match the original implementation
- Tested command-line arguments and help display
